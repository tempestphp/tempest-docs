Once again a month has passed, and we're tagging a new alpha release of Tempest. This time we have close to 70 merged pull requests by 12 contributors. We've also created a [backlog of issues](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/milestone/12) to tackle before 1.0, it's a fast-shrinking list!

I'll share some more updates about the coming months at the end of this post, but first let's take a look at what's new and changed in Tempest alpha.4!

## Asynchronous Commands

Async commands are a new feature in Tempest that allow developers to handle tasks in a background process. Tempest already came with a [command bus](https://tempestphp.com/docs/framework/commands/) before this release, and running commands asynchronously is as easy as adding the `#[AsyncCommand]` attribute to a command class.

```php
// app/SendMail.php

use Tempest\CommandBus\AsyncCommand;

#[AsyncCommand]
final readonly class SendMail
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $to,
        public string $body,
    ) {}
}
```

Dispatching async commands is done exactly the same as dispatching normal commands:

```php
use function Tempest\command;

command(new SendMail(
    to: 'brendt@stitcher.io',
    body: 'Hello!'
));
```

Finally, in order to actually run the associated command handler after an async command has been dispatched, you'll have to run `./tempest command:monitor`. This console command should always be running, so you'll need to configure it as a daemon on your production server. 

```console
~ ./tempest command:monitor
<success> Monitoring for new commands. Press ctrl+c to stop.</success>
```

While the core functionality of async command handling is in place, we plan on building more features like multi-driver support and balancing strategies on top of it in the future.
