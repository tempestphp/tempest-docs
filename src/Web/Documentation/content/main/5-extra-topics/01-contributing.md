### Setting up Tempest Locally
* Install PHP
* Install Composer
* [Fork the Tempest repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

Then in your terminal run:
```shell
cd /path/to/your/clone
composer update
```

You're ready to get started!

### Styling decisions
Tempest uses a modified version of PSR-12. We automate the entire styling process because we know everyone is used to different standards and workflows. To see some of the rules we enforce, check out our [Mago](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/blob/main/mago.toml) and [Rector](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/blob/main/rector.php) configurations.

The following outlines some other guidelines we have established for Tempest.

#### `final` and `readonly` as a default
Whenever possible, classes should be `final` and `readonly`. This practice promotes immutability and prevents inadvertent changes to logic.

#### Acronym casing
Tempest uses a modified version of the [.NET best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ms229043(v=vs.100)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) for acronym casing. Please see below for our guidelines:

__Do capitalize all characters of two to three character acronyms, except the first word of a camel-cased identifier.__
A class named `IPAddress` is an example of a short acronym (IP) used as the first word of a Pascal-cased identifier. A parameter named `ipAddress` is an example of a short acronym (ip) used as the first word of a camel-cased identifier.

__Do capitalize only the first character of acronyms with four or more characters, except the first word of a camel-cased identifier.__
A class named `UuidGenerator` is an example of a long acronym (Uuid) used as the first word of a Pascal-cased identifier. A parameter named `uuidGenerator` is an example of a long acronym (uuid) used as the first word of a camel-cased identifier.

__Do not capitalize any of the characters of any acronyms, whatever their length, at the beginning of a camel-cased identifier.__
A class named `Uuid` is an example of a long acronym (Uuid) used as the first word of a camel-cased identifier. A parameter named `dbUsername` is an example of a short acronym (db) used as the first word of a camel-cased identifier.

#### Validation class formatting
[final and readonly](#final-and-readonly-as-a-default)
2. __Error Message Formatting__:
    - __Avoid Ending Punctuation__: When crafting error messages for validation rules, refrain from including ending punctuation such as periods, exclamation marks, or question marks. This helps in maintaining a uniform style and prevents inconsistency in error message presentation.

__‚úÖ&nbsp;Good Example__
> Value should be a valid email address

__‚ùå&nbsp;Bad Example__
> Value should be a valid email address!

## Release workflow

**Tempest uses sub-splits to allow components to be installed as individual packages. The following outlines how this process works.**

### Workflow steps

1. **Trigger Event**
    - When a pull request is merged, or a new tag is created, the `.github/workflows/subsplit-packages.yml` action is run.

2. **Package Information Retrieval**
    - When the `subsplit-packages.yml` is run, it calls `bin/get-packages`.
    - This PHP script uses a combination of Composer and the filesystem to return (in JSON) some information about every package. It returns the:
        - **Directory**
        - **Name**
        - **Package**
        - **Organization**
        - **Repository**

3. **Action Matrix Creation**
    - The result of the `get-packages` command is then used to create an action matrix.
    - This ensures that the next steps are performed for _every_ package discovered.

4. **Monorepo Split Action**
    - The `symplify/monorepo-split-github-action@v2.3.0` GitHub action is called for every package and provided the necessary information (destination repo, directory, etc.).
    - This action takes any changes and pushes them to the sub-split repository determined by combining the "Organization" and "Repository" values returned in step 2.
    - Depending on whether a tag is found or not, a tag is also supplied so the repository is tagged appropriately.

## Commit and merge conventions

Commits must all respect the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/), so the changelog and release notes are generated using the commit history.

### Commit descriptions

Commit descriptions **should not** start with an uppercase letter and should use [imperative mood](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?h=v2.36.1#n181):

```diff
- feat(support): Adds some cool feature
+ feat(support): add some cool feature
```

### Commit scopes

Scopes are not mandatory, but are highly recommended for consistency and easy of read. The following scopes are the most commonly used:

- `feat` ‚Äî for a new feature
- `fix` ‚Äî for a bug fix
- `refactor` ‚Äî for changes in code that are neither bug fixes or new features
- `docs` ‚Äî for any change related to the documentation
- `perf` ‚Äî for code refactoring that improves performance
- `test` ‚Äî for code related to automatic testing
- `style` ‚Äî for refactoring related to the code style (not for CSS)
- `ci` ‚Äî for changes related to our continuous integration pipeline
- `chore` ‚Äî for anything else

Here are some commit examples:

```
feat(support): add `StringHelper` class
feat(support/string): add `uuid` method
perf(discovery): improve cache efficiency
refactor(highlight): improve code readability
docs: mention new `highlight` package
chore: update dependencies
style: apply php-cs-fixer
```

### Pull requests

Pull request titles and descriptions should be as explicit as possible to ease the review process.

Contributors are not required to respect conventional commits within pull requests, but doing so will ease the review process by removing some overhead for core contributors.

All pull requests will be renamed to the conventional commit convention if necessary before being squash-merged to keep the commit history and changelog clean.
