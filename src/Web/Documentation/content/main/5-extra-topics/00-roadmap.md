title: Roadmap
---

Tempest is still a work in progress, and we're actively working towards a stable 1.0 release. We keep track of that progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/milestones).

You're more than welcome to [contribute to Tempest](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework), you can even work on features in future milestones if anything is of particular interest to you. The best way to get in touch about Tempest development is to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/pPhpTGUMPQ).

The rest of this page will talk about the upcoming phases in Tempest's development.

## Alpha

Currently, we release a new alpha version of Tempest every month or two. Alpha versions can still contain breaking changes, but already include a framework that can be used to tinker with and build small project with. For example, this website is written in Tempest.

## Beta

Once Tempest is tagged as beta, we're committed to not do any more breaking changes, and only focus on bug fixing. Any issue included in [the alpha and pre-1.0 milestones](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/milestones) will have to be fixed before we consider tagging beta.

## Stable

We're committing ourselves that from 1.0 on, any subsequent versions of Tempest with breaking changes will get an automated upgrade path. Most likely we'll ship custom Rectors with every new major release, so that you can run a script to automatically upgrade your codebase to be compatible with the newest Tempest release.

## Post-1.0

We have a range of features that are not planned for 1.0, but should be added afterward. A couple of examples: mail support, HTMX support, multiple database connections, etc. You can [read the full list on GitHub](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/milestone/13).
