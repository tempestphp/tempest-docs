title: Roadmap
---

Tempest is still a work in progress, and we're actively working towards a stable 1.0 release. We keep track of that progress on [GitHub](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/milestones).

You're more than welcome to [contribute to Tempest](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework), and can even work on features in future milestones if anything is of particular interest to you. The best way to get in touch about Tempest development is to [join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/pPhpTGUMPQ).

## Version stability

Tempest is going through several stability stages:

- **Alpha**: during this phase, we'll add new features and refactorings, there will be breaking changes.
- **Beta**: we focus on bug fixing in preparation for the next major release
- **Stable**: the final release

Tempest is currently in the last 1.0 alpha version. The next tagged version will be **beta 1**, and thus focus on preparing for a stable 1.0 release.

## Experimental features

Given the size of the project, we decided to mark a couple of features as experimental. These features might still change after a stable 1.0 release has been tagged. Our goal is to rid all experimental components before Tempest 2.0. Here's the list of experimental features:

- [tempest/view](/main/essentials/views): you can use both [Twig](/main/essentials/views#using-twig) or [Blade](/main/essentials/views#using-blade) as alternatives.
- [The command bus](/main/tempest-in-depth/commands): you can plug in any other command bus if you'd like.
- [Authentication and authorization](/main/tempest-in-depth/auth): the current implementation is very lightweight, and we welcome people to experiment with more complex implementations as third-party packages before committing to a framework-provided solution.
- [ORM](/main/essentials/models): you can use existing ORMs like [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/) as an alternative.
- [The DateTime component](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework/tree/main/src/Tempest/DateTime): you can use [Carbon](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/) or [Psl](https://github.com/azjezz/psl) as alternatives.
- [Caching](/main/tempest-in-depth/caching): Tempest only adds a thing layer on top of PSR-6 and uses symfony's cache component underneath. However, there are some inconsistencies between our layer and the rest of Tempest's code. We plan on refactoring out implementation at one point, which is why we keep it as experimental for now.

Please note that we're committed to making all of these components stable as soon as possible. In order to do so, we will need real-life feedback from the community. By marking these components as experimental, we acknowledge that we probably won't get it right from the get-go, and we want to be clear about that up front.

## Upcoming features

Apart from experimental features, we're also aware that Tempest isn't feature-complete yet. Below is a list of items in our priority list. Feel free to contact us via [GitHub](https://github.com/tempestphp/tempest-framework) or [Discord](https://tempestphp.com/discord) if you'd like to suggest other features, or want to help out with one of these:

- Internationalization support
- Dedicated support for API development
- Mail support
- HTMX support combined with tempest/view
- Form builder
- Event bus and command bus improvements (transport support, async messaging, event sourcing, â€¦)
- Queuing and messaging components
